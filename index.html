        <p>Chick-Fil-A is one of the most popular retail places to eat, so many students use the GrubHub app to preorder their meals. Unlike other retail locations, orders do not get put into the system until a physical check-in is complete. This prolongs the wait time by a large amount, and ultimately defeats the purpose of preordering in the first place.</p>

        In our diagram, we organized the sticky notes into five categories: Outcomes, Logistics, Goals, App Basics, and Reward System. The Outcomes category explains what the website is intended to accomplish, while the Logistics category outlines the components and features that will accompany the new app. The Goals category highlights the objectives we aim to achieve through its development. The App Basics category defines the core structure and essential functions of the app. Lastly, the Reward System category introduces a new incentive program designed for users who place orders or regularly engage with the app.
