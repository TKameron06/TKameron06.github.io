          <p>
            Chick-Fil-A is one of the most popular retail places to eat, so many
            students use the GrubHub app to preorder their meals. Unlike other
            retail locations, orders do not get put into the system until a
            physical check-in is complete. This prolongs the wait time by a
            large amount, and ultimately defeats the purpose of preordering in
            the first place.

            In our diagram, we organized the sticky notes into five categories:
            Outcomes, Logistics, Goals, App Basics, and Reward System. The
            Outcomes category explains what the website is intended to
            accomplish, while the Logistics category outlines the components
            and features that will accompany the new app. The Goals category
            highlights the objectives we aim to achieve through its
            development. The App Basics category defines the core structure and
            essential functions of the app. Lastly, the Reward System category
            introduces a new incentive program designed for users who place
            orders or regularly engage with the app.

            station will look to a customer. In the third sketch, we
            illustrated how the order screen will appear to workers.
