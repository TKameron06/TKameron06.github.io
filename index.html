        <p>Chick-Fil-A is one of the most popular retail places to eat, so many students use the GrubHub app to preorder their meals. Unlike other retail locations, orders do not get put into the system until a physical check-in is complete. This prolongs the wait time by a large amount, and ultimately defeats the purpose of preordering in the first place.</p>

    <h1>Gamecock Volleyball</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Gamecock Volleyball is one of the major sporting events to watch here on campus. It has definitely become one of my favorite events. If you don't know anything about the sport, read this description given by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/volleyball">Britannica:</a> "Volleyball is a team sport played between two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The objective is to score points by grounding the ball on the opponent's court while preventing the same from happening on your own side. It is played both indoors and on the beach, requiring speed, strategy, and teamwork. Volleyball has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964."</p>
