        <p>Chick-Fil-A is one of the most popular retail places to eat, so many students use the GrubHub app to preorder their meals. Unlike other retail locations, orders do not get put into the system until a physical check-in is complete. This prolongs the wait time by a large amount, and ultimately defeats the purpose of preordering in the first place.</p>
